## Cost Savings on Infrastructure

Existing structures provide foundational elements like utilities, structural components, and zoning classifications, reducing the capital expenditure required for new construction. This approach can lead to savings of approximately 10â€“12% compared to building new facilities.

## Strategic Locations

These properties are often situated in areas with established transportation networks and proximity to urban centers, facilitating efficient logistics for both data center operations and agricultural product distribution.

## Accelerated Time to Market

Utilizing existing buildings can significantly shorten project timelines, allowing for quicker commencement of operations and revenue generation.

## Environmental and Regulatory Incentives

Adaptive reuse aligns with sustainable development goals, potentially qualifying projects for environmental incentives, tax credits, and grants aimed at promoting green initiatives and urban revitalization.

## Community Revitalization

Transforming vacant or underutilized properties can stimulate local economies by creating jobs, increasing property values, and enhancing the tax base, thereby contributing to broader economic development.

By leveraging these benefits, integrating smart farm data centers into repurposed real estate can be a cost-effective and sustainable strategy that supports both technological advancement and community development.
