# Bennefitting Local Economies by...

## Cost Savings on Infrastructure

Existing structures provide foundational elements like utilities, structural components, and zoning classifications, reducing the capital expenditure required for new construction. This approach can lead to savings of approximately 10â€“12% compared to building new facilities.

## Strategic Locations

These properties are often situated in areas with established transportation networks and proximity to urban centers, facilitating efficient logistics for both data center operations and agricultural product distribution.

## Accelerated Time to Market

Utilizing existing buildings can significantly shorten project timelines, allowing for quicker commencement of operations and revenue generation.

## Environmental and Regulatory Incentives

Adaptive reuse aligns with sustainable development goals, potentially qualifying projects for environmental incentives, tax credits, and grants aimed at promoting green initiatives and urban revitalization.

## Community Revitalization

Transforming vacant or underutilized properties can stimulate local economies by creating jobs, increasing property values, and enhancing the tax base, thereby contributing to broader economic development.

By leveraging these benefits, integrating smart farm data centers into repurposed real estate can be a cost-effective and sustainable strategy that supports both technological advancement and community development.

## Reclaiming Manufacturing

Converting former manufacturing hubs and commercial real estate into smart farm data centers has the potential to significantly impact local economies, especially in areas hit hard by industrial decline. This has tremendous positive impacts on communities as far as:

1. Job Creation
   * Direct Employment: Construction, retrofitting, and operation of smart farm data centers create immediate job opportunities in construction, engineering, IT, and farming.
   * Long-term Jobs: These facilities require skilled and semi-skilled labor for data center operations, smart farming, logistics, and maintenance.
   * Ancillary Employment: Increased demand for services such as food, transportation, and housing generates jobs in local businesses.
3. Increased Tax Revenue
   * Property tax contributions rise as buildings transition from being abandoned or underutilized to fully functional facilities.
   * Corporate and payroll taxes provide additional revenue streams for local governments, enabling reinvestment in infrastructure and community services.
5. Urban Revitalization
   * Vacant properties often become eyesores that contribute to urban decay. Repurposing them revitalizes the surrounding area, improving public perception and attracting further investment.
   * Adjacent businesses benefit from increased activity, which can lead to more robust local commerce.
7. Skill Development
   * Introducing data-driven industries like smart farming fosters the need for local educational programs, internships, and apprenticeships.
   * These opportunities equip residents with future-oriented skills, making them competitive in the modern workforce.
9. Economic Diversification
    * Transitioning to smart farming and tech infrastructure reduces dependency on traditional industries.
    * Diversification helps stabilize local economies against market volatility in a single sector.
11. Improved Land Use Efficiency
    * Combining indoor agriculture with data center cooling systems maximizes the utility of the space, turning underperforming properties into productive assets.
    * This innovation promotes sustainability and aligns with modern economic priorities like renewable energy and efficient resource use.
