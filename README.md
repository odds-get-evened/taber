## business plan for a self-sustaining smart farm & data-center

### components

* servers for data processing software, and data storage
* industrial space
* power requirements? wind/solar generators, and infrastructure (100% sustainable)
* [cooling](data_center_layout_heat_mgmt.md) (fans, water source, air quality management)
* physical security (employee badge access to video surveillance)
* building management system (BMS) (for monitoring the space's environment and controlling it)

### infrastructure needs

* servers
* disk storage
* networking
* cables and racks
* uninterruptible power (UPS)
* [software based management](ai_for_efficiency.md) platforms (for reporting on system health, availability, capacity and configuration)

### things to consider

* Uptime Institute Tier Standard - redundancy/reliability
* ANSI/TIA 942-B - planning, design, construction and commissioning of building trades, as well as fire protection, IT and maintenance
* EN 50600 series - IT cable and network design
* ASHRAE - design and implementation of heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration
