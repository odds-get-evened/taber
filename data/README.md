# data-serv

[over here :sunrise_over_mountains:](https://github.com/odds-get-evened/data-serv)

## what is it?

it is a micro-service that can send simulated data streams (primarily integer, float, double type ranges).

## why was it made?

for my lack of trust in using my laptop to monitor IoT devices over WiFi/COM/Bluetooth (security issues), I made `data-serv` to stream mock temperatures, but instead of simple randomness, I added thresholds as well to make it less jumpy, and simulate gradual real temps.
