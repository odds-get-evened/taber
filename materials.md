# Materials

## Power Generation

### Solar Power

* Solar Panels: High-efficiency photovoltaic (PV) panels.
* Mounting Structures: Fixed or tracking systems to position panels optimally.
* Inverters: Converts DC from the panels to AC for data center use.
* Cables and Wiring: Weather-resistant and suitable for high currents.

### Wind Power

* Wind Turbines: Horizontal or vertical axis turbines ([Aeromine](https://aerominetechnologies.com/) makes industrial roof mounted motionless turbines).
* Towers: Supports for wind turbines; must be tall enough to access optimal wind speeds (may be remote, and turbines on towers is not the only option).
* Generators: Converts mechanical wind energy to electricity.
* Controllers: Regulates power output from turbines.

### Energy Storage

* Battery Systems: Lithium-ion, lead-acid, or flow batteries for energy storage.
* Battery Management System (BMS): Ensures safe operation and optimizes battery life.
* Inverters/Chargers: For bidirectional power conversion between storage and load.

### Power Distribution

* Power Distribution Units (PDUs): Manages electricity within the data center.
* Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS): Provides short-term backup during power switching or outages.
* Switchgear and Circuit Breakers: Ensures safe and efficient distribution of power.
* Transformers: Steps voltage up or down for compatibility with equipment.
* Smart Meters:

### Monitoring and Control

* Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System: Monitors and controls solar, wind, and storage systems.
* IoT Sensors:
  * Weather sensors (wind speed, solar irradiance, temperature).
  * Power sensors (voltage, current, battery levels).
* Remote Monitoring Software: Provides real-time insights and alerts.
 
### Backup Power

* Diesel or Gas Generators: Ensures redundancy in case of prolonged periods of low sunlight or wind.
* Fuel Storage Systems: Tanks for diesel or gas.

### Environmental Control

* HVAC Systems: Maintains optimal temperature and humidity for servers.
* Heat Pumps: Use industrial-scale pumps for efficient heating and cooling.
* Insulation and Sealing: Ensures minimal energy waste.

### Site Infrastructure

* Building Refitting:
  * Roof Reinforcement: For mounting solar panels.
  * Grid Connection: Links excess power to local power grids (if necessary).
  * Ventilation and Airflow Management.
* Access Roads and Paths: For maintenance and transportation.
* Fencing and Security Systems: Protects equipment and infrastructure.

### Maintenance and Support

* Spare Parts: Inverters, batteries, and turbine components.
* Maintenance Equipment: Tools for inspecting and repairing installations.
* Skilled Technicians: For regular checks and emergencies.
