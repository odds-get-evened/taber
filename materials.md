# Materials

## Power Generation

### Solar Power

* Solar Panels: High-efficiency photovoltaic (PV) panels.
* Mounting Structures: Fixed or tracking systems to position panels optimally.
* Inverters: Converts DC from the panels to AC for data center use.
* Cables and Wiring: Weather-resistant and suitable for high currents.

### Wind Power

* Wind Turbines: Horizontal or vertical axis turbines ([Aeromine](https://aerominetechnologies.com/) makes industrial roof mounted motionless turbines).
* Towers: Supports for wind turbines; must be tall enough to access optimal wind speeds (may be remote, and turbines on towers is not the only option).
* Generators: Converts mechanical wind energy to electricity.
* Controllers: Regulates power output from turbines.

* Smart Meters:
  * [EKM Omnimeter Pulse UL v.4](https://www.ekmmetering.com/collections/smart-meters/products/ekm-omnimeter-pulse-ul-v4)
* Environmental Sensors (temp./humidity/light):
* IoT Gateways (data aggregators and communication)
* Edge Devices (local computation and processing)
* Communications components (WiFi, Zigbee, LoRa)
* Data Storage/Processing Units (Servers)
* Control Systems (HVAC, Lighting)
* Renewable Engery Componenets (Solar Panels, Wind Turbines
* Data Acquisition Systems (for integrating sensors)
* Backup Power Supply (UPS/batteries)
